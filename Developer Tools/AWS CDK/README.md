# Getting Started
## install
Install or update the AWS CDK CLI from npm (requires Node.js â‰¥ 14.15.0). We recommend using a version in Active LTS

```javascript
npm i -g aws-cdk
```

but, when you install in windows, first, you should launch CMD as admin, then change to node directory, then you can install CDK using command above.
